# EEE4463 Course Code Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing code and related materials for the EEE4463 course. It aims to provide a centralized location for all the programming tasks, projects, and examples related to the course content.

## Repository Contents
- **Source Code**: This directory will contain the main source code files for various algorithms and applications covered in the course. For example, there will be code related to machine learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, etc. Each model's code may be organized in a separate subdirectory for better management.
- **Data**: A folder to store any datasets used in the code. These datasets could be for training and testing the machine learning models or for data analysis tasks. The data may be in different formats such as CSV, JSON, or other relevant formats.
~~- **Documentation**: Here, you will find documentation related to the code, including function descriptions, usage instructions, and any relevant technical notes. This will help in understanding the purpose and functionality of the code.~~
~~- **Examples**: Sample code snippets and small projects that demonstrate the usage of the algorithms and techniques taught in the course. These examples can serve as a reference for students when working on their own assignments.~~

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using the command:
```bash
git clone [repository_url]
```
2. Navigate to the relevant directories to access the code, data, or documentation you need.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to run the code and perform the required tasks.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
- Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b [branch_name]
```
- Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages.
- Push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin [branch_name]
```
- Open a pull request in the original repository, describing the changes you have made.

## Future Additions
- **Project Reports**: [Placeholder for where project reports will be added once available.]
- **Additional Code Implementations**: [Space to mention any upcoming or planned code implementations related to advanced topics or improvements.]

## License
[To be determined based on the course's requirements and any applicable institutional policies.]
